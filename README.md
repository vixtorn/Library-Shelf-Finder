The Library Shelf Finder is a simple web application that allows users to input the name of a book and quickly locate the shelf where the book is stored.
The application highlights the corresponding shelf on the webpage, providing a visual aid to help users find their desired book within a simulated library environment. 
The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it serves as a practical example of DOM manipulation, event handling, and conditional rendering in JavaScript.

How to Use:
Input Book Name: Enter the name of the book in the provided input field.
Find the Shelf: Click the "Find Book" button to locate the shelf.
Visual Highlight: If the book is found, the corresponding shelf will be highlighted. If not, an alert will notify you that the book is not in the library.
Technologies Used:
HTML: For the basic structure of the webpage.
CSS: For styling the webpage and making the shelves visually distinct.
JavaScript: For the logic that handles book searching and shelf highlighting.
How to Run:
Clone the repository from GitHub.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
